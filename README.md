OpenAI has trained cutting-edge language models that are very good at understanding and generating text. The API provides access to these models and can be used to solve virtually any task that involves processing language.

This is a wrapper around OpenAI's API built with Swift and Vapor, a backend solution written in Swift.

## Installation

### Xcode Projects

Select `File` -> `Swift Packages` -> `Add Package Dependency` and enter `https://github.com/carloshmartins/OpenAISwift`.


### Swift Package Manager Projects

You can add `OpenAISwift` as a package dependency in your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
let package = Package(
    //...
    dependencies: [
        .package(
            name: "OpenAISwift",
            url: "https://github.com/carloshmartins/OpenAISwift",
            .exact("0.0.1")
        ),
    ],
    //...
)
```


<!-- üîë UNCOMMENT THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW IF THE GITHUB REPO NAME MATCHES THE LIBRARY NAME üëá -->

<!-- From there, refer to `MyLibraryName` as a "target dependency" in any of _your_ package's targets that need it.

```swift
targets: [
    .target(
        name: "OpenAISwift",
        dependencies: [
          "OpenAISwift",
        ],
        ...
    ),
    ...
]
``` -->

<!-- üîë UNCOMMENT THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW IF THE GITHUB REPO NAME DOESN'T MATCH THE LIBRARY NAME üëá -->

From there, refer to the `OpenAISwift` "product" delivered by the `MyPackageName` "package" inside of any of your project's target dependencies:

```swift
targets: [
    .target(
        name: "YourLibrary",
        dependencies: [
            .product(
                name: "OpenAISwift",
                package: "OpenAISwift"
            ),
        ],
        ...
    ),
    ...
]
```

<!-- Proceed from above choice accordingly (and delete this comment) -->

Then simply `import MyLibraryName` wherever you‚Äôd like to use it.


<!--
    üîë UNCOMMENT THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW IF USING THE `@_exported` feature
    might be handy. üëá
-->

<!-- **üìù Note:** To make the library available to your entire project, you could also leverage the [functionality of the `@_exported` keyword](https://forums.swift.org/t/package-manager-exported-dependencies/11615) by placing the following line somewhere at the top level of your project:

```swift
@_exported import OpenAISwift
``` -->

## üíª Developing

### Requirements

- Xcode 13.0+


### üìú Creating & Building Documentation

Documentation is built with [Xcode's DocC](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/docc). See [Apple's guidance on how to build, run, and create DocC content](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/docc/api-reference-syntax).

For now, the best way to view the docs is to open the project in Xcode and run the `Build Documentation` command. At some point in the future, I'm hoping to leverage the tooling the develops for generating/hosting DocC documentation. (Please feel free to let me know if you have any ideas or tooling recommendations around this üôÇ).


## üè∑ License

`OpenAISwift` is available under the MIT license. See the [LICENSE file](./LICENSE) for more info.
